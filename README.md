# YahtzeeScanner

This projects takes a photo of a filled Yahtzee (German: Kniffel) sheet and calculates the total
score of each player. Currently, only a simple python script exists to do the job at hand - 
the script is still work in progress and not functional yet!

In the future, this will be packaged as an Android app.
