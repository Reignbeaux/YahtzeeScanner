- Move project to git 
- Insert new photos without wrapped paper

- Add possibility to update template metadata

- Sort matches, use the best X matches

- Select the two regions of interest

- Calculate transformation between the two images
  (suppress outliers?)
  
- Get list of filled boxes (images!) by using the
  transformation
  
- Run edge detection for each; maybe better 
  use a threshold?
- Calculate bounding box(es) algorithm on each one

- Train a neural network on MNIST using PyTorch,
  also run the bounding box algorithm on each sample
